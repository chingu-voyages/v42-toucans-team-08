# Current Task Checklist - 6th Feb. 2023

#### Requirements

_Structure_

- [x] This is a purely frontend application. No backend is required.
- [x] Use the [Chuck Norris Facts API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to get the
      data you'll be presenting to the user.
- [x] You may use any languages, tools, or libraries you prefer when designing
      and building this app.
- [x] You may **_NOT_** use AI-base solution generators like GitHub Coilot.

_Styling:_

- [x] Add a footer containing a link to your teams GitHub repo

_Functionality_

- [x] Your app should present the user with options for displaying a random
      fact, one based on a category selected by the user, or one based on a text
      string entered by the user. You have the option of optionally including
      this in your app since some results from the API may be offensive to some
      users.
- [x] For category selection, users should be able to click on a 'Categories'
      element to reveal a list of categories they may choose from.
- [ ] For searching by a text string allow input in upper or lower case
- [x] For all of the above you **_must exclude_** any quotes in the "explicit"
      category and optionally, those from the "religious" and "political"
      category (see
      [Chingu Community Standards](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/914163956405395476/914165230119034900)).
      This also means that for the category selection requirement you shouldn't
      include "explicit" in the category list and you may also wish to exclude
      the other two as well.

_Upon Load:_

- [x] Display a random Chuck Norris fact

_Other:_

- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust
      [README](https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d)
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before
      submitting

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Give your user the option to limit the display of the results to a
      specific number of entries, or implement paging the results.
- [ ] Make your app
      [responsive](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/)
      so its UI/UX will be usable and attractive on a wide range of devices.
- [ ] Follow [A11Y principles and practices](https://www.a11yproject.com/) so
      your app will be accessible to users with impairments.
- [x] Allow the user to switch between light and dark modes.
- [ ] Add animation and visual effects to capture user interest in the page.
- [ ] Add a team page to highlight members of your team. Be sure to include
      links to their professional and social media.
- [ ] Allow the user to define how many facts are returned at one time. The
      default should be 1.
- [ ] Ensure that the same fact is not displayed to the user more than once in a
      session.
- [ ] Give the user the option to order the list of categories alphabetically or
      by categories they have most frequently used in the current session.
- [ ] Add a user profile feature and keep track of metrics such as the number of
      facts the user has retrieve or the number of times each type of search
      (ie. random, catgory, text) has been used.
- [ ] Add a filter to detect results containing offensive content so they won't
      be displayed.
- [ ] Be creative and come up with your own new features or enhancements!
